# Introduction-to-Optiperformer


## Aim
Download and install OptiPerformer software on your computer and run a sample file.

## Software required
Optiwave introduces OptiPerformer, a free photonic design automation tool which harnesses the full power of OptiSystem and creates specific dynamic design scenarios which can be used by students.

The system is *instrumented* with:
- An optical power meter at the input to the receiver (or the output of the fiber)  
- A bit error rate (BER) analyzer

---

## Instructions

1. Download and install OptiPerformer from the [optiwave.com](https://optiwave.com) website.
2. Copy the `Introduction_OptiPerformer.osp` file to your PC.
3. Start OptiPerformer.
4. Use either the **File menu** or the **Open File** button to open the Fiber Optic System File.
5. Study the layout, which includes text and boxes identifying the three components of the fiber optic system:
   - **Transmitter section**: binary source (PRBS generator), electrical pulse generator, laser diode, external modulator  
   - **Receiver section**: photodiode, low-pass filter, decision circuit (with BER analyzer)  
   *(These components will be covered in more detail later in the course.)*
6. Run the simulation by pressing the **Start** button.  
   - Progress will be displayed.  
   - The message *“Calculation Finished!”* will appear when complete.
7. Double-click on the optical power meter and BER analyzer.  
   - Move the windows as necessary for clarity.  
   - In the BER window, check the box **Show Eye Diagram**.  
   - The optical power meter shows power at the photodiode input in both watts and dBm.  
   - The BER window displays the eye diagram and quantities including **Max Q Factor** and **Min BER**.
8. The simulation runs **5 iterations**, with fiber length varying from 50 km to 150 km in 5 steps.  
   - The index is displayed in the upper right corner of the layout.  
   - Use the forward/reverse buttons in the lower left to step through iterations.  
   - Note changes in received power and BER display (eye diagram, Q factor, BER) with fiber length.

## Report

1. Cover sheet per the attached example.  
2. Tabulation of received power, Q factor, and BER for the 5 different fiber lengths.  
3. Plot of received power, Q factor, and BER versus fiber length.  
4. Description of the change in the eye diagram with increasing fiber length.
